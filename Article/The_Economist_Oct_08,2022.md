In the first round of Brazil's presidential election Jair Bolsonaro, the populist incumbent, did better than expected. He had been trailing Luiz Inacio Lua da Silva, a leftist ex-president, by double digits in the polls for months, but on the night he was only five points behind. The two candidates now head to a run-off on October 30th. Mr Bolsonaro, a fan of Donald Trump, falsely suggests that the election is likely to be rigged, and may not accept the result if he loses.

`在巴西总统选举的第一轮选举中，现任民粹主义者雅伊尔·博索纳罗的表现好于预期。几个雨来，他一直以两位数的支持率落后于左翼前总统路易斯·伊娜西奥·卢阿·达席尔瓦，但在当晚，他只落后5个百分点。两位候选人将在10月30日举行决选。博索纳罗是唐纳德·特朗普的粉丝，他错误地暗示选举可能被操控，如果他输了，可能不会接受结果。`

Russia went through the motions of illegally annexing four provinces of Ukraine, following sham referendums held at gunpoint. Vladimir Putin now claims that these provinces are part of Russia, but his spokesman was unable to say exactly where the borders might be. Russia does not fully control any of the four, and holds only roughly half of two of them. Mr Putin’s land-grab was widely condemned.

`在枪口威胁下举行了虚假公投后，俄罗斯采取了非法吞并乌克兰四个省的行动。弗拉基米尔·普京现在声称这些省份是俄罗斯的一部分，但他的发言人无法确切说明边界可能在哪里。俄罗斯没有完全控制这四个国家中的任何一个，而且只控制了其中两个地区的大约一半。普京攫取土地的行为受到了广泛谴责。`

Ukraine ignored it and continued to push back the Russian invaders. Its forces recaptured Lyman, a rail hub, and advanced rapidly in the south, where tens of thousands of Russian troops are at risk of being trapped on the west side of the Dnieper river. The bridges they might retreat across have been blown up. Some of Mr Putin’s henchmen sought to blame Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, for the shambles.

`乌克兰对此置之不理，继续击退俄国侵略者。军队重新夺回了铁路枢纽牛莱曼，并迅速向南部推进。在那里，数以万计的俄军有被困在第聂伯河西岸的危险。他们可以撤退的桥梁都被炸毁了。普京的一些亲信试图将混乱归咎于俄罗斯国防部长谢尔盖·绍伊古。`

The Kremlin said it had drafted 200,000 men to fight in Ukraine. At least 300,000 have fled Russia since the draft was announced. Finland stopped issuing tourist visas to Russians, many of whom have been using Helsinki airport to escape on planes that are not subject to sanctions.

` 克里姆林宫表示，已征召20万人前往乌克兰作战。自该草案宣布以来，至少有30万人逃离了俄罗斯，芬兰停止向俄罗斯人发放旅游签证。其中许多人一直在利用赫尔辛基机场乘坐不受制裁的飞机逃离。`

Germany’s €200bn($197bn) energy aid package fuelled fury in Europe. Some politicians said that by going it alone Germany had undermined a common approach to dealing with the energy crunch. The European Commission said it was committed to “avoiding harmful subsidy races” in the single market.

`德国2000亿欧元（合1970亿美元）的能源援助计划激起了欧洲的愤怒。一些政治家表示，德国单打独斗破坏了应对能源危机的共同方法。欧盟委员会表示，它致力于在单一市场“避免有害的补贴竞争”。`

 The inaugural meeting of the European Political Community took place in Prague. Leaders from the 27 member states of the EU and 17 other European countries, including Britain, Switzerland, Turkey, and by video link, Ukraine, gathered to discuss security and economic issues. The forum was proposed by Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, as a means of forging pan-European unity on a number of issues.

`欧洲政治共同体的成立会议在布拉格举行。来自欧盟27个成员国和其他17个欧洲国家的领导人，包括英国、瑞士、土耳其以及通过视频连接的乌克兰，聚集在一起讨论安全和经济问题。该论坛是由法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙提出的，作为在一些问题上凝聚泛欧洲团结的一种手段。`

Denmark called an early election for November 1st. The country faces soaring energy bills and is nervous about Russian aggression after two gas pipelines were sabotaged in nearby waters. Also, Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister, has come under pressure for having illegally ordered a cull of mink in 2020, believing it would help stop the spread of covid-19.

`丹麦提前在11月1日举行大选。该国面临着飙升的能源账单，而且在附近水域的两条天然气管道遭到破坏后，该国对俄罗斯的侵略感到紧张。此外，首相梅特·弗雷德里克因在2020年非法下令捕杀貂而收到压力，他认为这将有助于阻止新冠病毒的传播。`

After ravaging Cuba, Hurricane Ian swept through Florida, killing 120 people. That was the highest storm death toll in the state since 1935.

`飓风伊恩肆虐古巴后，横扫弗罗里达州，造成120人死亡。这是该州自1935年以来风暴死亡人数最高的一次。`

**The lady is for turning**

Britain's Conservative government plunged in the polls after markets punished its plan for unfunded tax cuts. A month after taking office, Liz Truss, the prime minister, is more unpopular than Boris Johnson, her predecessor, ever was, Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor of exchequer, dropped plans to abolish the 45% top rate of tax. The Tories bickered over welfare cuts and other polices. Standard & Poor's and Fitch put Britain's credit rating on a "negative" outlook.

`在市场惩罚了英国保守党政府无资金支持的减税计划后，其民调支持率大幅下降。上任一个月后，首相利兹·特拉斯比他的前任鲍里斯·约翰逊更不受欢迎，财政大臣夸西·夸腾放弃了废除45%最高税率的计划。保守党在削减福利和其他政策上争吵不休。标准普尔和惠誉将英国的信用评级展望定为“负面”。`

Thailand's constitutional court ruled that Prayuth Chanocha, the prime minister, had not exceeded the constitution's eight-year term limit and could stay in power. Mr Prayuth had been suspended from office by the court in August while it heard an opposition-party petition arguing that his time was up.

`泰国宪法法院裁定，总统巴育·查奥差没有超过宪法规定的8年任期限制，可以继续执政。巴育在今年8月被法院停职，当时法院听取了反对党的请愿书，称他的时间已经到了。`

Also in Thailand, dozens of people, mostly children, were murdered in a gun-and-knife attack at a day-care centre in the north-east. The suspect, said to be a former police officer, killed himself.

A grid failure in Bangladesh left 75% of the country without electricity. Power was restored to Dhaka, the capital, by evening, and to the rest of the country by the following day. Bangladesh, like many poor countries, is suffering from shortages of gas as Europe tops up its supplies for winter.

` 孟加拉国电网故障导致该国75%的地区没有电力供应。首都达卡在晚上恢复了供电，第二天全国其他地区也恢复了供电。随着欧洲为冬季增加天然气供应，孟加拉国和许多贫穷国家一样，正遭受天然气短缺的困扰。`

North Korea fired a ballistic missile that flew more than 4000 km, far enough to reach Guam. It was the fartheast a North Korean missile has ever travelled. A South Korean missile test ended in failure when it crashed to the ground.

The commander of Uganda's army, Lieutenant-General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, threatened on Twitter to invade neighbouring Kenya. It was a joke, but Kenyans did not find it funny. Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, stripped the general of his job but also promoted him. The general is his son, and possibly his favoured successor.

`乌干达军队指挥官Muhoozi Kainerugaba中将在推特上威胁要入侵邻国肯尼亚。这是一个笑话，但肯尼亚人并不觉得好笑。乌干达总统约韦里·穆塞韦尼剥夺了这位将军的职务，但也提升了他的职位。这位将军是他的儿子，可能也是他青睐的接班人。`

## The world this week Business

Elon Musk changed course and offered to go ahead with his $44bn deal to buy Twitter, but only if a forthcoming trial that could force him to complete the takeover is stopped. A recent preliminary hearing in the case did not go well for his legal team. The mercurial Mr Musk offered to take Twitter private in April, said the offer was on hold in May, and abandoned the deal in July, prompting the legal action. He has suggested that he will turn the platform into "X", an everything app, similar perhaps to the superapps that combine messaging, shopping and services in Asia.

`埃隆·马斯克改变了路线，提出继续推进440亿美元收购 Twitter 的交易，但前提是即将到来的一场可能迫使他完成收购的审判停止。对他的律师团队来说，此案最近的初步听证会进展并不顺利。反复无常的马斯克今年4月提出将 Twitter 私有化，5月表示该提议被搁置，7月放弃了交易，引发了法律行动。他表示，他将把这个平台变成"X"，一个无所不包的应用程序，也许类似于亚洲那些整合了信息，购物和服务的。`

**A cruel summer**

Stockmarkets rallied briefly over the first two days of trading of the fourth quarter, after a brutal sell-off at the end of the third quarter. Despite some gains in August, share indices recorded an overall loss from July 1st to September 30th. The S&P 500 was down by 5% over the quarter -- September was its worst month since March 2020, the start of the pandemic. The NASDAQ Composite shed 4% and Dow Jones Industrial Average 7%. The CSI 300, which comprises stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, finished the quarter 15% lower than at the start.

`在经历了第三季度末的残酷抛售之后，股票市场在第四季度的头两个交易日短暂反弹。尽管8月份有一些上涨，但从7月1日到9月30日，股票指数录得整体亏损。标准普尔500指数在这个季度下跌了5%——9月是自2020年3月大流行开始以来最糟糕的一个月。纳斯达克综合指数下跌4%，道琼斯工业股票平均价格指数下跌7%。由上海和深圳交易所成份股组成的沪深300指数本季度收盘较初下跌15%。`

Bond markets were calmer. The yield on ten-year British gilts eased back to around 4% after the government ditched its plan to scrap the top rate of income tax (two months ago the yield was around 2%). The yield on the ten-year US Treasury fell back to 3.6% having risen above 4%. In Britain banks started re-offering some mortgage products they had withdrawn amid the market uncertainty. The interest rate on an average two-year fixed rate mortgage rose above 6% for the first time since 2008.

`债券市场较为平静。在政府放弃废除所得税最高税率的计划后，10年期英国国债的收益率回落到4%左右（两个月前收益率在2%左右）。十年期美国国债的收益率在上升到4%以上后回落到3.6%。在英国，银行开始重新提供一些因市场不确定性而退出的抵押贷款产品。两年期固定利率抵押贷款的平均利率自2008年以来首次超过6%。`

OPEC+ said it would cut oil production by 2m barrels a day, around 2% of global supply. The headline figure is the biggest reduction to output since 2020, but some OPEC members are already struggling with production targets so the overall effect will be lower. Still, it was a blow for the Biden administration and European governments, which had pressed the cartel to keep cuts to a minimum so that prices don't rise. The White House press secretary said that OPEC was now clearly "aligning with Russia".

`OPEC+ 表示将削减石油日产量200万桶，约占全球供应量的2%。总体数字是自2020年以来最大的减产，但一些欧佩克成员国以及在努力实现产量目标，因此整体影响将较低。不过，这对拜登政府和欧洲各国政府来说是一个打击，它们曾向欧佩克施压，要求其将减产控制在最低限度，以防止油价上涨。白宫新闻秘书表示，欧佩克现在显然“与俄罗斯站在了一起”。`

Annual inflation in the Netherlands (measured by the CPI) surged to 14.5% in September. Energy prices were up by 200%, year on year. Turkey's inflation rate rose above 83%; transport and food prices increased at an even faster clip.

`荷兰的年度通货膨胀率（以 CPI 衡量）在9月份飙升至14.5%。能源价格同比上涨200%。土耳其的通货膨胀率超过83%；交通和食品价格的上涨速度更快。`

Australia's central bank lifted its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 2.6%. Markets had expected a bigger rise, but the bank defended the smaller move because the rate has "increased substantially" this year.

`澳大利亚中央银行将其主要利率提高了0.25个百分点，达到2.6%。市场原本预期利率会有更大幅度的上升，但央行为小幅加息进行了辩护，因为今年以来利率“大幅上升”。`

Executives at Credit Suisse had to battle rumors that the bank is in trouble. A memosent by the chief executive, Ulrich Korner, to staff, reassuring them about the bank's "strong capital base and liquidity position", elicited the opposite effect in the markets. Its credit default swaps, which act as an insurance of a default, soared to new highs. Cooler heads dismissed the idea that Credit Suisse would become the next Lehman Brothers.

`瑞士信贷的高管不得不反驳有关该行陷入困境的传言。该行首席执行官乌尔西里·科尔纳在给员工的一份备忘录中向他们保证，该行“强大的资本基础和流动性状况”，却在市场上引发了相反的效果。作为违约保险的信用违约互换飙升至新高。头脑冷静的人对瑞信将成为下一个雷曼兄弟的想法不屑一顾。`

Apple will have to adapt the charger for iPhones in the EU, after the European Parliament approved new rules to standardize charging points for linking electronic devices to USB-C connections. The change applies to all product, so some items made by Samsung and others will also have to adapt.

The World Trade Organization forecast that the global trade in goods, measured by volume, will grow by 3.5% this year, but by only 1% in 2023. Demand for imports will soften, it said, for a variety of reasons related to the squeeze on household spending.

`世界贸易组织预测，全球货物贸易，以数量衡量，今年将增长3.5%，但2023年仅增长1%。报告称，由于与家庭支出紧缩有关的各种原因，进口需求将会减弱。`

`拥有沃尔沃和莲花两大品牌的中国汽车制造商吉利收购了阿斯顿马丁7.6%的股份，吉利一直想从这家英国跑车制造商手中分一杯羹（它被视为该公司的潜在买家），并表示期待未来的合作。`

**Death and taxes**

Dignity, the only publicly listed funeral provider in Britain, reported a half-year pre-tax loss. The firm is not immune from the more earthly problems bedeviling other businesses. Rising fuel costs have caused it to consider a surcharge on the gas burned at its crematoriums. And although lower death rates from covid-19 are a blessing for us all, it has made year-on-year comparisons about the business difficult. Still, Dignity noted "positive signs" about its market, a nod to the fact that there will always be a demand for its services.

`英国唯一一家公开上市的殡仪馆Dignity公布了半年的税前亏损。该公司也不能幸免于困扰其他企业的更现实的问题。不断上涨的燃料成本以促使该公司考虑对火葬场燃烧的天然气征收附加费。尽管covid-19的死亡率降低对我们所有人来说都是一件好事，但这也使得该行业难以进行同比比较。尽管如此，Dignity还是指出了其市场的“积极迹象”，承认了对其服务的需求永远存在的事实。`

A large explosion badly damaged the Kerch road-and-rail bridge, which connects Russia with occupied Crimea and is vital for resupplying Russian forces operating in the south of Ukraine. Although Ukraine neither confirmed nor denied that it had carried out the attack, many assumed that it had done so. Only very limited traffic is now able to use the bridge. It was unclear whether the explosion was caused by a lorry-bomb, an underwater drone or a missile.

`一次大爆炸严重损坏了刻赤路铁桥，该桥连接俄罗斯和被占领的克里米亚，对向在乌克兰南部作战的俄罗斯军队提供补给至关重要。尽管乌克兰既没有证实也没有否认实施了这次袭击，但许多人都认为是乌克兰实施了袭击。现在只有非常有限的车辆可以通过这座桥。目前还不清楚爆炸是由卡车炸弹、水下无人机还是导弹引起的。`

Russia retaliated by pounding cities across Ukraine with often-inaccurate cruise missiles and drone strikes. The centre of Kyiv was struck for the first time since the start of the war. Ukraine's engineers sought to repair damage to infrastructure and its leaders argued that the attacts would feed the will to fight. In response, NATO countries vowed to speed up their deliveries of air-defence systems to Ukraine. So far, Mr Putin's attacks appear to have accomplished little militarily.

`俄罗斯的报复手段是用经常不准确的巡航导弹和无人机袭击乌克兰各地的城市。基辅市中心自战争开始以来首次遭到袭击。乌克兰的工程师试图修复受损的基础设施，其领导人辩称，这些吸引会助长战斗的意。作为回应，北约国家誓言加快向乌克兰交付防空系统。到目前为止，普京的攻击似乎在军事上收效甚微。`

Alexander Lukashenko, the dictatorial president of Belarus, sent troops to join a Russian task-force that is assembling on the country's border with Ukraine, possibly to launch another front in the war. Mr Lukashenko claimed the task-force was preparing for a Ukrainian attack on Belarus, for which there is no evidence.

`白俄罗斯独裁总统亚历山大·卢卡申科派遣军队加入了一支集结在白俄罗斯与乌克兰边境的俄罗斯特遣部队，可能是为了在战争中开辟另一条战线。卢卡申科声称，特遣部队正在为乌克兰进攻白俄罗斯做准备，但没有证据证明这一点。`

Britain's Supreme Court heard arguments on whether there should be another Scottish independence referendum. The Scottish National Party's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, claims that the issue has gone to court because the British government has no respect for Scottish democracy. If the court finds against the nationalists, Ms Sturgeon says she will use the vote in Scotland at the next general election as a de facto referendum on independence. The court will deliver its ruling in the coming months.

`英国最高法院听取了关于是否应该再次举行苏格兰独立公投的辩论。苏格兰民族党领袖尼古拉·斯特金声称，这件事闹上法庭是因为英国政府不尊重苏格兰的民主。如果法院是因为英国政府不尊重苏格兰的民主。如果法院做出不利于民族主义者的判决，斯特金表示，她将在下次大选中利用苏格兰的投票作为事实上的独立公投。法院将在未来几个月内作出裁决。`

**The truth will set you free**

A jury in Connecticut ordered Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist, to pay $965m in damages to eight families who lost loved ones in the Sandy Hook school massacre in 2012. For years Mr Jones has peddled falsehoods across his media empire that the shooting was staged by the government. His lies caused great distress to the parents. He remains defiant. After the verdict he claimed to be "proud" of being attacked for his views.

`康涅狄格州的一个陪审团命令阴谋论者亚历克斯·琼斯向在2012年桑迪胡克学校大屠杀中失去亲人的8个家庭致富9.65亿美元的赔偿金。多年来，琼斯先生一直在他的媒体帝国散布谣言，称枪击事件是政府策划的。他的谎言给父母带来了极大的痛苦。他仍然目中无人。在判决之后，他声称为自己的观点收到攻击而感到自豪。`

Joe Biden said there would be "consequences" for America's relationship with Saudi Arabia following OPEC's decision to cut oil production in order to increase the commodity's price. Some Democrats said OPEC was supporting Russia's war (Russia also benefits from higher oil prices). Bob Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, promised to freeze arms sales to the Saudis.

`乔·拜登表示，欧佩克决定削减石油产量以提高大宗商品价格后，美国与沙特阿拉伯的关系将产生“后果”。一些民主党人说欧佩克是在支持俄罗斯的战争（俄罗斯也从高油价中受益）。参议院外交关系委员会主席 Bob Menendez 承诺冻结对沙特的武器销售。`

Turbulence persisted in Iran, nearly a month after it was sparked by the death of a young woman in the custody of the "morality" police for being "improperly" veiled. University students remained prominent in the nationwide protests. It was unclear how the army, as opposed to the hardline Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the loyalist Basij militia, would respond.

`一名年轻女子因“不恰当地”戴面纱而被“道德”警察拘留期间死亡，引发了动乱，近一个月后，动乱仍在伊朗持续。在全国范围内的抗议活动中，大学生仍然发挥着重要作用。目前尚不清楚，与强硬路线的伊斯兰革命卫队和忠于政府的巴斯基民兵组织相对的军方将如何应对。`

Under American mediation, Israel and Lebanon agreed on a maritime boundary that should allow each country to co-operate in the extraction of undersea gas. The deal may still need official approval in both countries.

Japan's Epsilon-6 space rocket was sent a self-destruct command less than seven minutes into its launch. The rocket and the commercial satellites it was carrying fell into the sea east of the Philippines. The aborted launch was Japan's first rocket failure in nearly two decades.

`日本的 Epsilon-6 号太空火箭发射不到7分钟就发出了自毁指令。这枚火箭及其搭载的商业卫星坠入菲律宾以东海域。这次失败的发射是日本近20年来第一次火箭发射失败。`

Kim Jong Un, North Korea's dictator, oversaw the launch of two long-range cruise missiles. State media said the objective was to test the reliability of nuclear-capable weapons. The launch follows two weeks of tactical nuclear exercises by the dictatorship in response to joint naval drills by South Korea and America.

`朝鲜独裁者金正恩监督来两枚远程巡航导弹的发射。官方媒体称，此次发射的目的是测试可携带核武器的武器的可靠性。此次发射之前，朝鲜进行了为期两周的战术核演习，以回应韩国核美国的联合海军演习。`

Local elections in New Zealand resulted in a tilt to the right, as big cities elected conservative mayors. This may indicate a turn away from the governing Labour Party led by Jacinda Ardern.

`新西兰的地方选举结果是向右翼倾斜，大城市选举了保守派市长。这可能预示着对由杰辛达·阿德恩领导的执政党工党的转变。`

Nepal faced severe disruption from torrential rain and landslides, which have killed at least 33 people. The country's western region is the worst affected, with more than 18 people still missing and hundreds of houses flooded.

Revolution for Prosperity, a political party set up just six months ago by a tycoon, won 56 of 120 seats in parliamentary elections in Lesotho.

In Nigeria Peter Obi, an outsider, took an early lead in polls as campaigning started for presidential elections in February.

**Please send help**

Haiti's prime minister, Ariel Henry, asked for intervention by a foreign armed force to avert a "major humanitarian crisis". Gangs have been blocking deliveries from the main fuel terminal since September and have seized control of motorways, forcing businesses and hospitals to close and causing shortages of food and bottled water. A woman was killed in clashes between police and protesters. An outbreak was reported of cholera, a disease that has killed 10,000 Haitians in recent years.

`海地总理阿里儿·亨利要求外国武装力量进行干预，以避免一场“重大的人道主义危机”。自9月以来，犯罪团伙一直在阻止主要燃油终端的运输，并控制了高速公路，迫使企业和医院关闭，造成食品和瓶装水短缺。一名妇女在警察和抗议者的冲突中被打死。据报道，海地爆发了霍乱，这种疾病近年来已造成1万名海地人死亡。`

The bank of England acted again to stabilise bond markets and increased its maximum daily purchases of long-dated gilts. The central bank is buying the bonds through a temporary program it created after markets took fright at the government's plans for unfunded tax cuts. The program is supposed to end on October 14th. British pension funds want it to be extended. They are taking a hit from collateral calls on derivatives linked to bond prices, leaving them with a short-term financing problem.

With markets expecting the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates, the yield on American government bonds has also increased.

`由于市场预期美联储将继续提高利率，美国政府债券的收益率也有所上升。这推高了美国与收益率相关的抵押贷款利率。据美国抵押贷款银行家协会的数据，30年期固定利率抵押贷款利率已攀升至6.8%以上，为2006年以来的最高水平。`

Global inflation is expected to peak later this year but remain elevated in 2023, said the IMF in its latest outlook.

Billions of dollars were wiped off the stockmarket value of Chinese chipmakers, after the Biden administration issued new export controls that severely curtail their access to American technology. The sell-off in shares soon extended to chipmakers in other countries. The new rules will make it much harder for Chinese companies to develop supercomputers and will slow their advance in artificial intelligence, a technology in which China claims to be a world leader.

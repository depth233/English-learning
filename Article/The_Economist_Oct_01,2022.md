## The world this week Politics

Italy’s nationalist right triumphed at a general election. An alliance of three parties headed by Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy won a solid majority in both houses of parliament. Ms Meloni is all but certain to become Italy’s first female prime minister.Though her party has neofascist roots, she has tried to present a reassuring face to voters. She promises not to ban abortion or gay civil partnerships, and to stick broadly with Italy’s economic reform plans as agreed with the European Commission in Brussels. The markets seemed relaxed about her victory.<br>`意大利民族主义右翼在大选种获胜。由梅罗妮的兄弟党领导的三党联盟在议会中赢得了稳固的多数席位。梅罗妮几乎肯定会成为意大利的首位女总理。尽管他的政党由新法西斯主义的根源，但她一直试图向选民展示一副让人放心的面孔。她承诺不会禁止堕胎或同性恋民事伴侣关系，并将大体上坚持与布鲁塞尔欧盟委员会达成一致的意大利经济改革计划。市场似乎对她的胜利感到愉悦。`

Russia staged sham referendums in four partly occupied provinces of Ukraine. Residents were asked, sometimes at gunpoint, whether they wanted their land to be annexed by Russia. The Kremlin’s local puppets announced that nearly everyone voted Yes. If Vladimir Putin formally annexes the provinces, he could then claim that Ukrainian troops defending their own country are on “Russian” soil. Ukraine dismissed Mr Putin’s theatrics and vowed to keep fighting. Ukrainian forces were reportedly close to surrounding the occupied town of Lyman, a supply hub.<br>` 俄罗斯在乌克兰四个部分被占领的省份举行了虚假的公投。居民被问及是否希望他们的土地被俄罗斯吞并，有时是在枪口的威胁下。克里姆林宫的傀儡宣布几乎所有人都投了赞成票。如果弗拉基米尔·普京正式吞并了这些省份，他就可以宣称，保卫自己国家的乌克兰军队是在俄罗斯领土上。乌克兰驳斥了普京的表演，并发誓要继续战斗。据报道，乌克兰军队已接近被占领的供给中心莱曼镇。`

Russian men desperate not be sent to fight and die in Ukraine fled form Russia. Hundreds of thousands have left so far. The Kremlin has not yet banned the exodus, but security officers were posted at some border crossings to serve call-up papers to fugitives. Protests against the draft erupted all over Russia, fuelled by revelations that new recruits were being asked to bring their own supplies. At least 20 recruiting centres were attacked.<br>` 不顾一切的俄罗斯人从俄罗斯逃到了乌克兰。目前已经有数十万人离开。克林姆林宫还没有禁止外逃，但是安全官员被派往一些边境口岸，向逃亡者发放征兆文件。俄罗斯各地爆发了反对征兵的抗议活动。被曝新兵要求自带补给的消息更是火上浇油。至少20个招募中心遭到袭击。`

Explosions caused leaks from two underwater gas pipelines linking Russia and Germany, Nord Stream 1 and 2. The supply of Russian gas to Europe was unaffected, since Mr Putin had already halted deliveries via Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 had never won permission to operate. Russian media blamed sabotage by  America or Ukraine. Others suspect the Kremlin was behind it, perhaps in the hope of frightening Europeans into reducing their support for Ukraine.<br>` 爆炸导致连接俄罗斯和德国的两条水下天然气通道北溪一号和二号泄露。俄罗斯对欧洲的天然气供应没有受到影响，因为普京已经停止了通过北溪一号和二号的输送，而北溪二号从来没有取得运营许可。俄罗斯媒体职责美国或者乌克兰的蓄意破坏。还有人怀疑克里姆林宫是幕后黑手，也许是希望吓唬欧洲人，让他们减少对乌克兰的支持。`

Japan held a state funeral for Abe Shinzo, a former prime minister who was assassinated by a lone gunman in July. The funeral divided Japan. Though Abe was a giant on the world stage, he was not universally liked at home. Many Japanese were angry at the cost of the funeral, and at links between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, to which Abe belonged, and the Unidication Church, a religious group that some describe as a cult, to which his killer attributed his anger.<br>` 日本为前首相安倍晋三举行了国葬，他在七月被一名单独的枪手刺杀。葬礼分裂了日本。虽然安倍是世界舞台上的巨人，他在国内并不是所有人都欢迎。愈多日本人对葬礼的花费感到愤怒，对安倍所属的执政的自民党，与被一些人成为邪教的统一教会之间的联系感到愤怒，凶手将他的愤怒归咎于统一教会。`

He promised to control prices and cut interest rates.<br>` 由于燃料和能源价格以及货币疲软导致的通货膨胀飙升，巴基斯坦更换了他的财政部长。新上任的伊沙克·达尔此前三次担任该职位。他承诺要控制物价并降低利率。他承诺要控制物价并降低利率。`

**Storm watch**

Hurricane Ian bore down on western Florida. More than 2m house holds lost power as surges of water caused flooding. Ian had earlier hit Cuda, knocking out electricity across the entire island. It came a week after Hurricane Fiona crossed the Caribbean. In Puerto Rico an estimated 244,000 people are still without power. Fiona’s remnants battered Canada’s Atlantic provinces and eastern Quebec, causing widespread damage.<br>` 飓风伊恩逼近弗罗里达西部。洪水泛滥导致200多万户家庭断电。伊恩早些时候袭击了库达，导致整个岛的电力中断。这发生在飓风菲奥娜穿过加勒比海一周之后。在波多黎各，估计任有244,000人没有电力供应。菲奥娜飓风的残余袭击了加拿大大西洋沿岸的省份和魁北克东部，造成了广泛的破坏。`

The IMF thinks that oil production will double this year.<br>`国际货币基金组织预测圭亚那的经济今年将增长57.8%。2015年发现的石油使这个与委内瑞拉接壤的南美小国。国际货币基金组织认为今年石油产量将翻一番。`

Some polls suggest he could defeat the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist, in the first round on October 2nd.<br>`在投票开始的前几天，民调显示左翼前总统路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉达·席尔瓦将赢得巴西总统选举。一些民调显示，他可能在10月2号的第一轮选举种击败现总统，右翼民粹主义者雅伊儿·波索纳罗。`

Protests continued in dozens of towns across Iran, following the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of being improperly dressed. Women sick of pious strictures joined men fed up with being ruled by corrupt theocrats. The authorities said at least 41 people had died; human-rights groups said the true figure was at least twice as high. Ebrahim Raisi, the ultra-conservative president, said that Ms Ahmini’s death was “tragic”, but indicated that he would not tolerate further unrest.<br>`在被道德警察指控穿着不当的年轻女子马赫萨·阿米尼在警察拘留期间死亡之后，伊朗各地数十个城镇的抗议活动仍在继续。厌倦了虔诚约束的女性加入了受够了腐败神权统治的男性行列。当局表示，至少有41人死亡；人权组织表示，真实数字至少是这个数字的两倍。极端保守的总统伊布拉辛·拉西表示，阿米尼之死是悲剧，但是他表示不会容忍进一步的动荡。`

King Salman of Saudi Arabia, mindful of his frail health at the age of 86, appointed his son, Crown Prince Muhammad, already the country’s defacto ruler, to be prime minister, a post previously held by the monarch.

Niger stopped the transit of fuel shipments to Mali, apart from those going to a UN peacekeeping mission. The fuel embargo adds pressure on Mali, which is growing increasingly isolated in the region since its government was overthrown by army officers in two coups. The junta has angered its neighbours by steadfastly refusing to hand power to civilians and, more recently, by detaining soldiers from Ivory Coast who were supporting the UN mission.<br>`尼日尔停止了运往马里的燃料运输，除了用于联合国维和任务的燃料。燃料禁运增加了马里的压力。自马里政府在两次政变种被军官推翻以来，该国在该地区正变得越来越孤立。军政府坚决拒绝将权力移交给平民，最近又拘留了支持联合国任务的科特迪瓦士兵，这激怒了邻国。`

The American Senate broke an impasse to approve a bill that will temporarily fund the government and keep it running past the end of the fiscal year. Trying to avoid a goverment shutdown has become an annual game of brinkmanship between Democrats and Republicans.<br>`美国参议院打破僵局，批准了一项法案，为政府提供临时资金，并使其运行到本财年结束后。试图避免政府关门已经成为民主党和共和党之间的年度边缘政策游戏。`

**A separation of powers**

Mitch McConnell, the Republicans’s leader in the Senate, endorsed a bill that would change the rules for counting electoral votes in Congress after a presidential election. The bill aims to prevent events like the protests of January 6th 2021, when supporters of Donald Trump stormed the Capitol. It would clarify that the vice-president’s role in the count is ceremonial, a response to Mr Trump’s demand that Mike Pence overturn the voters’s wishes.<br>`参议院共和党领袖米奇·麦康奈尔支持一项法案，该法案将改变总统选举后国会选举人票计数规则。该法案旨在防止类似2021年1月6日唐纳德·特朗普的支持者冲进国会大厦的抗议活动。它将澄清，副总统在点票中的作用是仪式化的，这是对特朗普要求迈克·彭斯推翻选民意愿的回应。`

## The world this week Business

Markets took fright at the British government’s announcement of huge tax cuts. The cuts, laid out by Kwasi Kwarteng, the new chancellor of the exchequer, include reductions to payroll taxes, income taxes and stamp duty. Investors were perturbed by the amount of borrowing required to pay for the cuts, the biggest for half a century. Mr Kwarteng had disregarded common practice by not asking the Office for Budget Responsiblity, an independent watchdog, for its assessment. The Treasury tried to reassure markets by announceing that he would unveil a medium-term fiscal plan, but not until November 23rd.<br>`市场对英国政府宣布的大幅减税感到恐慌。新财政大臣夸西·夸腾提出的削减措施包括削减工资税、所得税和印花税。投资者对支付削减所需要的借款数额感到不安，这是半个世纪以来最大的一次，kwarteng先生无视惯例，没有向独立监管机构——预算责任办公室征求评估意见。财政部试图通过宣布他将公布中期财政计划来安抚市场，但要等到11月23日`

**An omnishambles**

“The markets will react as they will,” said Mr Kwarteng after producing his tax cuts. The pound was hammered, dropping briefly to its lowest level on record against the dollar. It also fell sharply against other currencies. The cost of British government debt soared; the yield on ten-year bonds rose to 4.3%, up by one percentage point over a week. Banks withdrew hundreds of mortgage products because of the uncertainty. Citing a “material risk” to Britain’s financial stability, the Bank of England intervened. It said it would buy long-term government bonds for 13 days on whatever scale is necessary “to restore orderly market conditions”.<br>`Kwarteng 在提出他的减税方案后表示：“市场德反应将随其自然。”英镑收到重创，兑美元汇率一度跌至历史最低水平。兑其他货币的汇率也大幅下降。英国政府债务成本飙升；十年期债券收益率上升至4.3%，一周内上升了一个百分点。由于不确定性，银行撤回了数百种抵押贷款产品。英国央行以英国金融稳定面临“重大风险”为由进行了干预。美联储表示，他将购买为期13天的长期政府债券，购买规模无论如何，“以恢复有序的市场环境”。`

The rout in British gilts was the most dramatic element of a wider sell-off in government bonds. Yields have been rising as the Federal Reserve talks tough on inflation. The yield on the US ten-year Treasury bond touched 4% before falling back. Stockmarkets also had a rollercoaster week. The S&P 500 fell to its lowest level in nearly two years and the Dow Jones Industrial Average entered bear territory when it reached 20% below its peak in January.<br>`英国金边债券的暴跌时政府债券更大范围抛售中最引人注目的因素。随着美联储在通胀问题上态度强硬，收益率一直在上升。美国十年期国债收益率在回落前触及4%。股市也经历了过山车般的一周。标普500指数跌至近两年来的最低水平，道琼斯工业股票平均价格指数跌至比1月份峰值20%的熊市区间。`

The IMF urged Britain to reevaluate the tax cuts. It said it was monitoring the situation and was “engaged with the authorities”, statements it would normally make when a develping economy faces a suden crisis. The fund said it would not recommend introducing a “large and untargeted” fiscal package, “given elevated inflation pressures”.<br>`国际货币基金组织敦促英国重新评估减税政策。该行表示，正密切关注事态发展，并与当局接触。正常情况下，当发展中经济体面临突然危机时，该行会发表这样的声明。基金会表示，鉴于通胀压力升高，它不会建议推出大规模且无针对性的财政方案。`

Sterling is not the only currency to have tumbled against the dollar this year. The euro and the yen have also fallen. The chinese yuan dropped this week to a near 14-year low, threatening to break its trading range around the dollar, despite interventions by China’s central bank. The Indian rupee sank to a new low.<br>`英镑并不是今年兑美元汇率下跌的唯一货币。欧元和日元也在下跌。尽管中国央行进行了干预，但人民币汇率仍跌至近14年来的低点，有可能突破围绕美元的交易区间。印度卢比跌至新低。`

House prices in America rose by 15.8% in July, year on year, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index. In June prices rose by 18.1%. The decline of 2.3 percentage points in the growth rate was the largest ever for the index. With interest rates on the rise, mortgage finance has become more expensive, which could see home prices continue to cool.<br>`根据标普CoreLogic Case-Shiller指数，美国房价7月份同比上涨15.8%。6月份，价格上涨了18.1%。增长率下降2.3个百分点是该指数有史以来最大的降幅。随着利率的上升，抵押贷款变得更加昂贵，这可能会导致房价继续降温。`

**Electric milestones**

America’s Department of Transportation approved plans to deveplop infrastructure for electric vehicles in all 50 states, and build a network of charging points covering 75,000 miles(120,700km) of highway across the country. Meanwhile Hertz struck a deal with BP’s EV charging business to build a network of stations for its rental cars. Hertz is aiming for 25% of its fleet to be electric by the end of 2024.<br>`美国交通部批准了在所有50个州发展电动汽车基础设施的计划，并在全国建立覆盖75,000英里（120,700公里）高速公路的充电站网络。与此同时，赫兹与英国石油公司的电动汽车充电业务达成协议，为其出租汽车建立一个充电站网络。赫兹的目标是到2024年底，25%的车队是电动的。`

Porsche made its stockmarket debut on the Frankfurt exchange. Volkswagen priced the stock at €82.50($79.80) a share, the top end of the price range it had laid out. The IPO is the biggest in Europe for a decade, making Porsche one of the largest carmakers worldwide by market value.<br>`保时捷在法兰克福证券交易所首次上市。大众将该股定价为每股82.50欧元（合79.80美元），这是该公司设定的价格区间的高端。这是10年来欧洲规模最大的IPO，使保时捷成为全球市值最大的汽车制造商之一。`

A pre-trial hearing was held on Elon Musk’s decision to withdraw his takeover offer for Twitter. The hearing deliberated over which documents will be allowed as evidence. Twitter’s lawyers said Mr Musk had not provided them with any research backing his claim that the platform hosts more fake and spam user accounts than it acknowledges, which is the thrust of Mr Musk’s case for ditching the deal. The trial starts on October 17th.<br>`就埃隆·马斯克决定撤回对推特的收购要约举行了审前听证会。听证会审议了哪些文件可以作为证据。Twitter的律师表示，马斯克没有向他们提供任何研究，来支持他的说法，即该平台托管的虚假和垃圾用户账号比其承认的要多，这是马斯克放弃交易的理由。审判将于10月17日开始。`

Unilever announced that Alan Jope will retire as chief executive at the end of 2023. Mr Jope’s tenure saw much upheaval at the consumer-goods giant, which ended its Anglo Dutch dual structure and based its single headquarters in London. Earlier this year it abandoned plans to buy Glaxo SmithKline’s consumer healthcare business. Mr Jope belives that brands “without a purpose” have no future at Unilever. The company’s purposedriven approach was lambasted in January by Terry Smith, an investor, who said that “repeating corporate gobbledegook is not a solution” to improving performance.<br>`联合利华宣布艾伦·乔普将于2023年底卸任首席执行官一职。乔普的任期见证了这家消费品巨头的巨变。他结束了英荷两家公司的双重结构，将总部设在伦敦。今年早些时候，该公司放弃了收购葛兰素史克消费者保健业务的计划。乔普认为，在联合利华没有目标的品牌是没有前途的。今年一月，投资者特里·史密斯严厉抨击了该公司的目标导向型做法，他说，要提高业绩，重复企业的套话不是解决方案。`

## The world this week Politics

Jeremy Hunt, Britain's new chancellor of the exchequer, ditched almost all of the unfunded tax cuts in the government's mini-budget; the cuts had helped cause mayhem in the markets when they were announced on September 23rd. Mr Hunt was appointed to the job after Kwasi Kwarteng was unceremoniously sacked as chancellor by Liz Truss, the prime minister. Mr Hunt, a former foreign secretary, has put the Treasury firmly back in control of policy, a humiliation for Ms Truss, who had promised to rip up "abacus economics". Amid chaotic scenes in Parliament, speculation swirled about how long Ms Truss could last.

`英国新任财政大臣杰里米·亨特在政府的迷你预算中抛弃了几乎所有没有资金支持的减税措施；9月23日宣布降息时，市场一片混乱。亨特时在夸西·夸腾被首相利兹·特拉斯毫不客气地解雇后被任命为财政大臣的。前外交大臣亨特让财政部重新牢牢掌握了政策的控制权，这对曾承诺撕毁“算盘经济学”的特拉斯来说是一种耻辱。在议会混乱的场面中，人们纷纷猜测特拉斯女士还能留任多久。`

Adding to the tumult Suella Braverman resigned from her job as home secretary after just 43 days. In a parting shot, Ms Braverman, who is on the Tory right, laid into the government's lack of direction.

`更让人不安的是，休拉·布雷夫曼刚担任内政大臣43天就辞职了。在临别讲话中，保守党右翼的布雷夫曼女士抨击政府缺乏方向。`

**As winter approaches**

Russia once again pounded Ukraine with waves of cruise-missile and drone attacks, aimed at the country's electrical infrastructure in the hope of freezing Ukraine into submission. Russia seems to have acquired huge stocks of cheap Iranian drones. But Ukraine has been able to shoot down many of the frones and missiles and has so far been quick to restore power to affected areas. Overall capacity is suffering though, so rationing seems increasingly likely.

`俄罗斯再次用巡航导弹和无人机袭击乌克兰，目标是该国的电力基础设施，希望让乌克兰屈服。俄罗斯似乎已经获得了大量伊朗廉价无人机的库存。但乌克兰已经击落了许多正面导弹，并迅速恢复了受影响地区的电力供应。不过，整体产能受到影响，因此实行定量配给的可能性似乎越来越大。`

Ukraine's counter-offensive in the south appeared to be gaining momentum as the Russian occupation authorities in the city of Kherson started to evacuate civilians and move administrative offices across the Dnieper river. Adding to the sense of crisis, Vladimir Putin announced that martial law was being imposed in the four provinces that Russia has partially occupied. Kherson, one of the most significant gains for the Russians since the invasion began, may soon be back in Ukrainian hands.

`乌克兰再南部的反进攻似乎势头正盛，位于科尔森市的俄罗斯占领当局开始疏散平民，并将行政办公室迁到第聂伯河对岸。弗拉基米尔·普京宣布，在俄罗斯部分占领的四个省份实行戒严，这更增加了危机感。科尔森市俄罗斯自入侵以来取得的最重大进展之一，可能很快就会回到乌克兰手中。`

Mr Putin suggested that his mobilization drive to bolster army numbers was nearly over, and that 220,000 men had been drafted. Gunmen opened fire at a training ground for new recruits in Belgorod, close to the Ukrainian border, killing 11 people. The gunmen are reported to be Tajik nationals who had been recruited to fight in Ukraine and had got into a row over religion.

`普京表示，他增加军队数量的动员行动已接近尾声，22万人已被征召入伍。枪手在靠近乌克兰边境的别尔哥罗德的一个新兵训练场开枪，打死11人。据报道，枪手是塔吉克人，他们被招募到乌克兰参加战斗，因宗教问题发生争执。`

Elon Musk reversed course, and promised that Spacex, a rockets and satellites company that he runs, would continue to fund electronic communications in Ukraine through its Starling internet network. Starlink has become a vital strategic tool for Ukrainian forces fighting Russia.

`埃隆·马斯克改变了做法，承诺他经营的火箭和卫星公司Spacex将继续通过其星城互联网网络为乌克兰的电子通信提供资金。“星链”已经成为乌克兰军队对抗俄罗斯的重要战略工具。`

The head of Germany's cyber-security authority, Arne Schonbohm, was sacked for allegedly having close ties with Russian firm linked to a former KGB officer was a member of a private cyber-security organisation that Mr Schonbohm established a decade ago. The interior ministry is carrying out an investigation.

`德国网络安全主管Arne Schonbohm被免职，原因是他被指控与一家与前克格勃官员有关的俄罗斯公司有密切关系，而这家公司是Schonbohm先生十年前建立的一家私人网络安全组织的成员。内政部正在进行调查。`

Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, extended the lifespan of the country's three remaining nuclear-power plants until mid-April, in the hope of averting an energy-supply crisis over the coming winter.

`德国总理奥拉夫·肖尔茨将该国剩余的三座核电站的使用寿命延长至4月中旬，希望避免即将到来的冬季能源供应危机。`

His Moderate Party heads a centre-right governing coalition that includes the Christian Democrats and the Liberals, with support in parliament from the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats.

`瑞典议会确认Ulf Kristersson为总理。一个多月前，瑞典社会民主党在选举中被赶下台。他的温和党领导着一个包括基督教民主党和自由党在内的中右翼执政联盟，在议会中得到反移民的瑞典民主党的支持。`

In Turkey 41 miners were killed by an explosion at a coal mine in Amasra, 400km east of Istanbul. The mine is owned by the state. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, suggested the blast was caused by "fate", adding that an investigation would reveal the cause.

`在土耳其，伊斯坦布尔以东400公里的阿玛斯拉的一处煤矿发生爆炸，41名矿工丧生。这个矿归国家所有。雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安表示，爆炸是“命运”造成的，并补充说，调查将揭示原因。`

The UN discussed possible responses to the violent chaos in Haiti. A pair of resolutions have been drafted by the United States and Mexico. They would impose sanctions against gang members and their backers and leave open the possibility of sending a security force to the country. Russia and China may still veto the resolutions.

`联合国讨论了对海地暴力混乱可能采取的应对措施。美国和墨西哥已经起草了两份决议。他们将对黑帮成员及其支持者实施制裁，并保留向该国派遣安全部队的可能性。俄罗斯和中国仍有可能否决这些决议。`

As protests against the regime persisted across Iran, a fire broke out in the notorious Evin prison on the outskirts of Tehran, where many political prisoners are held. The authorities said the death toll had risen from four to eight, with dozens more injured, but independent sources were unable to verify the figure.

## The world this week Business

Markets reacted positively to the British government's decision to scrap most of its unfunded tax cuts. The yield on 30-year gilts fell back to around 4.2%, still higher than it was just before the mini-budget spooked investor in late September. The pound traded around \$1.12, not far off its lows in recent days. Jeremy Hunt, the new chancellor, is reportedly mulling windfall taxes on banks and energy companies to help plug a fiscal gap still worth tens of billions of pounds. Big cuts to public spending are also in the offing.

`英国政府决定取消大部分无资金支持的减税措施，市场对此反应积极。30年前英国国债收益率回落至4.2%左右，仍高于9月份迷你预算令投资者恐慌之前的水平。英镑兑美元汇率在1.12美元左右，离近几日的低点不远。据报道，新任财政大臣杰里米·亨特正在考虑对银行和能源公司征收暴利税，以帮助填补仍高达数百亿英镑的财政缺口。公共开支的大幅削减也在酝酿之中。`

The Bank of England said it would start selling the bonds it has accumulated through its quantitative-easing programs on November 1st, but only short-and medium-dated gilts and not bonds with a maturity of more than 20 years, which saw the sharpest sell-off in the recent turmoil. The central bank started buying longer-maturity bonds in late September to calm markets, but after two weeks that programme has now ended.

`英格兰银行表示，将于11月1日开始出售通过量化宽松计划积累的债券，但只出售中短期金边债券，而不是期限超过20年的债券，这些债券在最近的动荡中遭遇了最严重的抛售。央行在9月下旬开始购买较长期债券以安抚市场，但两周后该计划现已结束。`

**Food for thought for Mr Hunt**

Britain's annual inflation rate rose in September, hitting 10.1% (the level it was at in July). Food prices made the largest contribution to inflation between August and September. They have risen by 14.6% over the past year. Although that was the biggest jump since 1980, staples like milk and butter were up by even more, some 30%. Energy costs were up by 70%, as gas prices nearly doubled over the year. There is no sign of the cost-of-living crisis receding for British households.

`英国的年度通货膨胀率在九月份上升，达到10.1%（与七月份持平）。在8月到9月间，食品价格对通货膨胀的贡献最大。去年上涨了14.6%。尽管这是自1980年以来的最大涨幅，但牛奶和黄油等主要食品的涨幅更大，约为30%。能源成本上涨了70%，天然气价格在过去一年几乎翻了一番。没有迹象表明英国家庭的生活成本危机有所缓解。`

A raft of earnings from America's big banks showed a decline in profits as rocky markets took a toll on their lucrative investment-banking business. But at Goldman Sachs, where net income was down by 43%, year on year, another problem is its expansion into retail banking. Its boss, David Solomon, anounced another reorganization of the bank, splitting up its consumer business by rolling its savings and wealth products into asset-management and putting lending into a new division called Platform.

`由于动荡的市场打击了美国大银行利润丰厚的投资银行业务，他们的大量收益显示利润下降。但在净利润同比夏季那个43%的高，另一个问题是其向零售银行业务的扩张。该行老板大卫·所罗门宣布了另一项银行重组计划，将储蓄和财富产品并入资产管理，将消费业务拆分，并将贷款业务并入一个名为平台的新部门。`

Swiss Re estimated that its claims from Hurricane Ian would come in at \$1.3bn, causing a quarterly loss of \$500m. The reinsurance company reckons the total insured market loss from the storm, which hit west Florida in September, would be between \$50bn and \$65bn. That could make it the second-most costly hurricane for insurers, behind Katrina in 2005.

`瑞士再保险公司估计，飓风伊恩带来的索赔将达到13亿美元，造成5亿美元的季度损失。这家再保险公司估计，去年9月袭击弗罗里达州西部的这场风暴给保险市场造成的总损失将在500亿至650亿美元之间。这可能使它成为保险公司损失第二大的飓风，仅次于2005年的卡特里娜飓风。`

The International Energy Agency said that, “defying expectations”, global carbondioxide emissions are expected to grow by only 1% this year. The increase would have been much larger, it said, if it were not for the take-up of renewable energy and electric cars.

`国际能源机表示，“违背预期”，今年全球二氧化碳排放量预计仅增长1%。报告称，如果不是可再生能源和电动汽车的使用，增幅将会更大。`

Tesla reported quarterly revenues of \$21.5bn, its most ever, and a solid profit of \$3.3bn. The company has delivered fewer cars than it had forecast, but raised their price as the cost of parts for the vehicles increased. Investors wonder whether this could continue in a recession.

Netflix gained a net 2.4m subscribers in the third quarter, more than twice the number it had forecast and reversing six months of customer losses.

`Netflix 第三季度用户净增加240万，是其预期的两倍多，扭转了连续6个月客户流失的局面。该流媒体服务目前拥有2.23亿用户，远远超过迪士尼+等竞争对手。为了吸引观众，Netflix将很快推出一项由广告支持的更便宜的订阅计划。`

`美国两大连锁超市克罗格和艾伯森同意以246亿美元的价格合并。两家公司都表示，他们“预计将剥离门店”，以满足竞争监管机构的要求，后者将质疑该行业的整合。`

Beyond Meat is cutting its workforce by a fifth. The plantbased meat industry was flavour of the month a few years ago, but consumers are now tightening their belts and have lost an appetite for pricier alternative-meat products. Longer established food companies have responded to inflation by pushing up prices. Nestle is the latest to report surging revenues, even though sales volumes fell.

`Beyond Meat将裁员五分之一。几年前，以植物为基础的肉类工业是当月的风味，但消费者现在正勒紧腰带，失去了对更昂贵的替代肉类产品的胃口。成立时间较长的食品公司通过推高价格来应对通胀。雀巢是最新公布收入飙升的公司，尽管销售额有所下降。`

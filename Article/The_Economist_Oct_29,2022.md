## The world this week Politics

More than 230 people have been killed and over 12,000 have been arrested, according to tallies by human-rights group, as protests rage on in Iran. The movement against the ayatollahs’ regime has largely been led by women. In response to the violence, America has lengthened the list of individuals and groups subject to sanctions. The ruling clerics seem uncertain whether to give ground or crack down more fiercely.

`据人权组织的统计，随着伊朗抗议活动的爆发，已有超过230人被杀，超过12000人被捕。反对阿亚图拉政权的运动主要是由妇女领导的。作为对暴力的回应，美国延长了受到制裁的个人和团体的名单。执政的神职人员似乎不确定是做出让步还是更严厉地镇压。`

Israeli defence forces killed five Palestinians in a raid into the West Bank city of Nablus, where an Israeli soldier had been killed earlier this month. A sixth Palestinian was killed in a later incident.

`以色列国防军在对约旦河西岸城市纳布卢斯地突袭中打死5名巴勒斯坦人，本月早些时候，纳布卢斯有一名以色列士兵被杀。第六名巴勒斯坦人在后来的事件中丧生。`

Opinion polls preceding the Israeli election scheduled for November 1st show no clear favourite. The two leading contenders are blocs led by Yair Lapid, the incumbent prime minister, and Binyamin Netanyahu, a long-serving former prime minister. Pundits reckon that Mr Netantahu’s alliance has a slight edge.

`定于11月1日举行的以色列大选之前的民意调查显示，没有明确的支持率。两个领先的竞争者是由现任总理亚伊尔·拉皮德和长期任职的前总理本雅明·内塔尼亚虎领导的集团。专家们认为内塔尼亚虎的联盟有一点优势。`

**Shifting the goalposts**

In the lead-up to the football World Cup, which kicks off on November 20th in Qatar, the country faces mounting compaints about labour abuses and the persecution of gay people. Watchdogs allege the arbitary arrests of gay activists. Some football stars have said they will be wearing armbands to show support for victims.

`在11月20日卡塔尔开幕的足球世界杯的准备阶段，这个国家面临着越来越多的关于虐待劳工和保护同性恋者的抱怨。监督机构指控政府任意逮捕同性恋活动人士。一些足球明星表示，他们将佩戴袖章，以表示对受害者的支持。`

Peace talks between the Ethiopian government and the rulers of Tigray, a rebellious northern province, have started after nearly two years of civil war. Millions of civilians in Tigray are under blockable by the government and have not received aid since fighting resumed in August.

`在经历了近两年的内战后，埃塞俄比亚政府和北部叛乱省份提格雷的统治者开始了和平谈判。提格雷数以百万计的平民被政府封锁，自8月战斗恢复以来，他们没有得到援助。`

At least 50 people were killed and 300 injured when police in Chad intervened in protests demanding civilian rule. The protests erupted after the junta that seized power in April 2021 broke its promise to hand power to a civilian administration this month.

`乍得警方干预要求文官统治的抗议活动，造成至少50人死亡，300人受伤。抗议活动是在2021年4月掌权的军政府违背本月将权力移交给文官政府的承诺后爆发的。`

Rishi Sunak became Britain’s third prime minister in two months, taking over from Liz Truss. Ms Truss, who resigned after a disastrous mini-budget spooked financial markets, was the shortest-serving prime minister in history. Mr Sunak was the only candidate for leadership of the ruling Conservative Party to garner enough nominations from Tory MPS enter the race, after efforts by Boris Johnson to mount a comeback stalled.

`里希·苏纳克接替利兹·特拉斯，成为两个月内英国的第三任首相。特拉斯是历史上任期最短的首相，她在一份灾难性的小预算惊吓了金融市场后辞职。在鲍里斯·约翰逊试图东山再起的努力陷入停滞之后，苏纳客是唯一从参与竞选的保守党议员中获得足够提名的执政保守党领袖候选人。`

In an attempt to bring the Tories together, Mr Sunak appointed a cabinet from different wings of the party. Jeremy Hunt was reappointed chancellor; James Cleverly, a backer of Mr Johnson, remained foreign secretary. The reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary stocked controversy; she had been forced to resign from the same position days earlier after sending an official document from her personal email.

`为了将托里党团结在一起，Sunak先生从该党的不同派别中任命了一个内阁。杰里米·亨特再次被任命为财政大臣，约翰逊的支持者詹姆斯·聪明仍担任外交大臣。重新任命苏埃拉·布雷夫曼为内政大臣充满了争议；几天前，在用个人邮箱发送了一份官方文件后，她被迫辞去了统一职位。`

Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the nationalist Brothers of Italy party, was sworn in as prime minister of Italy. She has promised strong support for Ukraine. Some observers fear a more confrontational relationship with Brussels, though she will want to maintain access to Italy’s  €200bn($201bn) share of the EU’s covid recovery fund, which comes with strings attached.

`民族主义的意大利兄弟党领袖梅罗妮宣誓就职意大利总理。她承诺对乌克兰提供强有力的支持。一些观察人士担心，意大利与布鲁塞尔的关系将变得更具对抗性，尽管她将希望继续获得欧盟新冠疫情恢复基金中意大利所占的2000亿欧元（合2010亿美元）份额，这是有附加条件的。`

Without producing evidence, Russia alleged that Ukraine was preparing to set off a nuclear dirty bomb on its own territory.

`在没有提供证据的情况下，俄罗斯声称乌克兰正准备在自己的领土上引爆脏弹。`

Observers in Ukraine and elsewhere were fearful that this might mean that Russia was itself planning to set one off, hoping to blame Ukraine. Foreign ministers of America, Britain and France were sufficiently alarmed to issue a joint statement warning Russia that it would be held accountable.

`乌克兰和其他地方的观察人士担心，这可能意味着俄罗斯自己也在计划引爆炸弹，希望把责任推给乌克兰。美国、英国合法国的外交部长们对此非常震惊，他们发表了一份联合声明，警告俄罗斯将对此负责。`

Pennsylvanian voters saw perhaps the most closely watched debate of the midterm elections. John Fetterman, the Democrat running to be senator, met Mehmet Oz, a celebrity doctor and the Republican nominee. Questions about Mr Fetterman’s fitness for office have been raised after he suffered a stroke in May. His perfomance did not allay concerns as he struggled to rebut Mr Oz or explain his positions.

`宾夕法尼亚州的选民可能看到了中期选举中最受关注的辩论。正在竞选参议员的民主党人约翰·费特曼遇到了著名医生、共和党提名人默罕默德·奥兹。自从莫特曼在5月份中风后，他是否适合担任公职的问题就被提了出来。当他竭力反驳奥兹或解释自己的立场时，他的表现并没有减轻人们的担忧。`

A controversial letter signed by 30 progressive Democrats asking Joe Biden's administration to pursue negotiations with Russia to end the war in Ukraine was published and then quickly withdrawn by the caucus's chair, Pramila Jayapal. The letter was criticised for undercutting the American position on Ukraine. Ms Jayapal claimed that the letter had been written months earlier and was released by staff without vetting.

`30名进步民主党人签署了一封有争议的信，要求乔·拜登政府与俄罗斯进行谈判以结束乌克兰战争，该信被公布，然后由核心小组主席普拉米拉·贾亚帕尔迅速撤回。这封信因削弱美国对乌克兰的立场而受到批评。Jayapal女士声称，这封信是几个月前写的，工作人员未经审查就发布了这封信。`

Jair Bolsonaro, the populist incumbent, and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist former president, were polling at 48% and 52%, respectively, in the lead­up to Brazil’s presi- dential elections. That is a technical tie, given the mar­gin of error. The last few weeks of the campaign have been marred by violence, polarisation and personal attack heavy political ad­vertisements from both sides.

`在巴西总统选举之前，民粹主义现任总统贾伊尔·博尔索纳罗和左翼前总统路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦的投票率分别为48%和52%。鉴于错误的边缘，这是一个技术平局。竞选活动的最后几周受到双方暴力、两极分化和人身攻击的大量政治广告的破坏。`

**Pressed for freedom**

Roberson Alphonse, a Haitian investigative journalist, survived an attempted assassination in Port­au­Prince, the country’s capital. Although the situation in the country is worsening, it is unlikely that an American­backed security force will be deployed to the island soon. The European Union expressed concern at the “humanitarian catastro­phe” unfolding in Haiti.

`海地调查记者Roberson Alphonse在该国首都太子港的一次未遂遂中幸存下来。尽管该国局势正在恶化，但美国支持的安全部队不太可能很快部署到该岛。欧洲联盟对海地正在发生的“人道主义灾难”表示关切。`

Arshad Sharif, a Pakistani journalist, was shot dead at a police checkpoint in Kenya on October 23rd. Mr Ashraf was a supporter of Imran Khan, Pakistan’s former prime minister. At home, Mr Khan is threatening to march with his supporters on Islamabad, the capital, agitating for early elections. This may lead to clashes with the country’s security forces.

`10月23日，巴基斯坦记者Arshad Sharif在肯尼亚的一个警察检查站被枪杀。Ashraf先生是巴基斯坦前总理Imran Khan的支持者。在国内，Khan先生威胁要和他的支持者一起在首都伊斯兰堡游行，鼓动提前选举。这可能会导致与该国安全部队发生冲突。`

European natural-gas prices fell below €100 ($100.8) per megawatt hour for the first time since Russia cut supply in June, as lower demand amid mild weather and large amounts of gas in storage helped to ease concerns about winter shortages.

`自6月俄罗斯切断供应以来，欧洲天然气价格首次跌破每兆瓦时100欧元（100.8美元），因为温和天气和储存大量天然气的需求下降，这有助于缓解人们对冬季短缺的担忧。与去年同期相比，大消费国意大利的天然气需求在8月和9月下降了十分之一。`
